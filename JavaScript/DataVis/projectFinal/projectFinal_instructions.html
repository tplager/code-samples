        <h1>Final Project</h1>

        <h2>Due Date</h2>

        <p>Monday, April 27, 11:59 PM. You will present your Final Project to the
          class during Finals Week. This may change given our current alternative learning methods,
          but plan on presenting your project even if just to me.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>Time to bring everything we've learned in this class together to craft
          a data-driven story backed by an exploratory interactive visualization.
          You will be creating a project that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Uses real data that has been cleaned and analyzed.</li>
          <li>Uses D3 to build an interactive visual that allows the user to
            <strong>explore</strong> the data.
          </li>
          <li>Optimizes use of marks and channels to maximize effectiveness.</li>
          <li>Tells a story that is backed by the data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <h3>Data</h3>

        <p>The data set must be large enough that it requires interactivity for the user to explore. This may be
          due to to the number of data points or due to the number of data variables.
        </p>

        <p>The data may come from a single-source or be derived from multiple-sources. Data should be
          cleaned and analyzed.  You will need to submit all datasets (sources, derived sets) and cite where the
          data originally came from. The data should be real data from a reputable source.
        </p>

        <h3>Exploratory and Interactive Visualization</h3>

        <p>The primary experience should be exploratory and interactive. This can take the form of an application-like
          visualization (such as this interactive stock chart for <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/chart?p=IBM#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">IBM</a>
          on Yahoo Finance, or the projects by <a href="https://fathom.info/projects/#visualization">Fathom</a>) or a journalistic approach where a visualization evolves as the user explores the page
          (such as this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/07/us/politics/how-democrats-took-the-house.html">NY Times</a> article).
        </p>

        <p>Interactivity should be purposeful and designed to invite exploration in ways that make the data easy to explore.
          We will discuss these ideas further in class 13.2 and 13.3 as you ramp up to develop the project.
        </p>

        <p>Be careful not to make an interactive visualization just for the sake of checking off boxes: do be sure that the data and story are ones that will benefit from an exploratory visualization.
        </p>

        <h3>Style</h3>

        <p>The project's style should be polished and not get in the way of the story and visualization.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Find data that you would like to work with. Analyze it to see what are its data variables
            and sketch out some ideas on what kind of visualization makes sense to use. Think about
            interactivity and how it might help for the data you have.
          </li>
          <li>Create a development plan for the visualization.</li>
          <li>Develop the initial, non-interactive visualization as a starting point for your work.
          </li>
          <li>Continue to iterate through the development of the visualization.</li>
          <li>Fill in the story (text, images), and finish out the design.</li>
          <li>Write out your documentation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Documentation</h2>

        <p>This project needs to have documentation that explains:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>How you worked with the data.</li>
          <li>What you analyzed about the data in terms of data variables and how that informed your choice of visualization.</li>
          <li>Your design for the visualization: what channels and marks are in use and why did you choose them? What scales and axes are in use and why did you use them?
            What other information (e.g., legends) did you use and why did you use them?
          </li>
          <li>What are the interactions in the visualization? Why did you use each one? What aspect of working with data does the interaction address?</li>
          <li>Your development process.</li>
          <li>Overall project experience.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Grading</h2>

        <p>This project is worth 30% of your final grade. It is broken down into:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Interactive Visualization: 60%</li>
          <li>Data Work: 10%</li>
          <li>Written Story: 5%</li>
          <li>Final Presentation: 5%</li>
          <li>Style: 10%</li>
          <li>Documentation: 10%</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Timeline</h2>

        <p>Starting early, developing a development plan, and working a set amount each day
          will help to make this project move along smoothly. Be sure to divide the project
          into "must-have's" and "nice-to-have's" and take care of the important things first.
          Also, be sure to factor in time for the unexpected, as it always happens.
        </p>

        <ul>
